5,Works Great With My Cat,"I've had several cats, most of which didn't have much of a hairball problem.  However, the cat I have now, has hocked up some epic hairballs. She's the best cat I've ever had, except for this one nasty problem.<br /><br />So, I bought a small bag of this hairball control from my vet, tried it, and it does seem to have had an effect on my cat's massive hairball problem.  In fact, after about a month of mixing this with her other food, I've noticed that she's only thrown up once or twice, and that's certainly not as much as she did before.<br /><br />I found this bag on Amazon for quite a bit less than what my vet charged, so I'll continue to order it here. Based on what I've observed with my cat so far, I would highly recommend this for those of you who have cats with the same problem."
5,"Great cat food, great value",I adopted my cat from a shelter and this is the type of food they fed him and urged me to continue feeding him. He absolutely loves it and I won't be changing brands or food anytime soon. It seems to be a very high quality dry cat food and it's definitely one that my cat loves. The big bag of food is great especially if you have large Rubbermaid (etc) containers to store it in so it doesn't get stale. I'm very happy with this food and I'm very glad the shelter (and my vet) ended up recommending it. My cat is happy and I'm happy knowing he is being fed appropriately with high quality food that is helping him stay healthy.
5,cat food,"its cat food that was offered at a good price...and being a premier member, i got free speedy shipping.  cat food starts out hard when it enters the cat.  it exits the kitty as a soft item a day later, minus nutrients/vitamins (hopefully)."
5,Thank God I found this food!,"We have 2 cats, one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house. We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again. So I'll say it again: thank goodness for this food!!!"
5,Best for Dental Health,"The vet showed me that my 14-year-old cat's teeth and gums were in bad shape. Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day. If your cat has no problems yet, consider giving her a small handful of Hill's Dental nuggets to ward off any future problems. This stuff works!"
5,Can't live without this cat food,Have been using this cat food now for a few years after the vet recommended dental cleaning (very expensive & put them under anesthesia - no way!).  Our cat is healthy and her teeth seem to be in good condition.  She loves the taste and size.  She won't eat any small food anymore (I have tried some samples) and actually eats all the Science Diet and leaves the small ones for me to discard.  It's a bit pricey but I would recommend it.
3,Meh,"I bought this for my cat, who suddenly started vomiting on a daily basis. No rhyme or reason for it either, not hairballs, or some kind of illness. This didn't help the vomiting issue and considering the cost of the food and composition, I've since switched her to a product richer in proteins that costs a similar amount and actually seems to have quickly cleared up the problem."
5,The only thing all my cats will eat!,"I have three very different cats, with very different tastes. The Science Diet adult hairball formula is one all three will eat without a fuss. They really like the taste, and have been eating it for years. Plus, it really works to prevent hairballs! I've tried many different brands, but I always come back to this one because I know it's high quality and they will eat it. If they ever stop making this particular one I'm in trouble, they don't seem to like the other Science Diet kinds!"
3,Way more expensive per pound than the larger-sized bags of the same food,"I posted my review for the quality of this cat food here: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MWBFXY"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach Dry Cat Food - 15.5-Pound Bag</a>, which is the same food as this but in a larger bag.  Here, I just wanted to point out that this smaller size bag is actually much more expensive.  As of the date I'm writing this, this 3.5-pound bag costs $3.71 per pound, whereas the 7-pound bag costs $3.50 per pound and the 15.5-pound bag costs $2.32 per pound.  So you pay over 50% more per pound for this size compared with the largest size.  Just wanted to point this out in case it could save anyone money!  I like the cat food a lot."
4,Has mostly cleared up our vomiting problem,"My 5-year-old kitty has always eaten Science Diet (first the kitten formula, then the Adult Indoor formula), and has always been very healthy with a gorgeous coat and lots of energy.  A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.  The vet said there was nothing wrong and she was probably just eating too fast.  We immediately switched over to this Sensitive Stomach version and the vomiting frequency decreased dramatically.  Now she vomits only once every two or three months.  I'm skeptical that there is anything really different about this food, and it could have just been a coincidence that she stopped vomiting after we switched.  Still, I'd rather just stick with this kind than find out.  I took away one star because it is, in my opinion, unreasonably expensive."
5,The only thing that worked,"I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat."
4,"Bag keeps getting smaller, price stays the same","My cat has been eating this for years, and it seems that the bag keeps getting smaller and the price (for a while) kept going up!  My cat has very sensitive stomach - so this does the trick.  I just hoped it contained more meat verses fillers!"
5,My cat likes the taste,"My cat is 13 years old.  I had been feeding her Friskies Dental Diet for most of her adult life, but it was discontinued.  While on the dental diet she never needed to have her teeth cleaned.  I decided to try the Science Diet brand.  She seems to really enjoy the taste of it.  I mix it with some smaller dry food and she picks out the large Science Diet food first.  It's too soon to see if it will work as well as the Friskies on her teeth, but hopefully it will."
5,Huge difference,"Like other reviewers, I have a cat who would get sick often. I had her checked for issues, but she is otherwise healthy.<br /><br />So when a my new vet suggested a sensitive stomach food, such as this, I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />The difference is amazing. She still has an occasional hairball (this doesn't fix that issue...I didn't expect it to. And my fluffball has more fur than any other living creature, so I can handle a once-a-month hairball). But her near daily throwing up has stopped."
5,wish I'd started using it 5 years ago,"I have two litter mates.  One can eat anything with no problem.  The other always vomits ten minutes after eating, no matter what she eats: canned or dried makes no difference and I've tried every store brand there is.  Hairball treatments had no effect.  I figured ""cats throw up"" and didn't worry about it.  When I moved and switched vets the new vet asked if the cats ever threw up.  When she heard about the one cat she said cats do NOT just throw up and told me to get the Science Diet sensitive stomach food.  Yes, it's 4x the price of what I'd been buying, but I noticed a difference with the first bowl.  Instead of throwing up ten minutes after literally every meal, now she throws up maybe once a month.  If only I'd switched to this brand years ago we both would have been saved a lot of misery.  Even tho it costs more I've noticed that the bag seems to last longer than the same amount of cat chow did."
4,My cats like this!,"Since Frisky no longer makes those great little round balls of Dental Diet cat food, I had to go looking for something else. Science Diet seemed to be the only likley alternative. My cats liked the different size and texture of the round balls but in their infinite wisdom Frisky (the nitwits) decided there wasn't a market for the product any longer. Fat lot they know. Our three cats don't love this ""dental diet cat food"" as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats."
5,The best thing for cat's teeth,"Although it may seem just a tad precious, our vet recommended this for a young cat who doesn't brush.  He has clean teeth, fresh breath, and I hope will have all his teeth all his life.  Plus, both he and his girl friend love the taste!"
1,Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard,"I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I ""transitioned"" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of ""transitioning"" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real."
1,Please avoid!!,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo."
3,Too large for cats,"This food may be good for my cats, but two of my ragdolls, and these are large cats, will not eat the chunks because they are so large."
5,Excellent for good health of cat,"After a year on kitten food, one of my two cats began to get rather chubby.  He had a hard time hauling himself up onto one of the cat perches in the house.  We switched to this food when they hit their one-year birthday, and my little chubby cat began to lose weight.  Now, a year later, the indoor cat formula is all they eat, and my cat can jump up to the top bunk of the cat perch with no problems at all.  He has an all-star physique.  I do have to say, they preferred the kitten food too at first, but when given no other options, they eat this food with no problems.  If you look at the nutritional content of the food, indoor cat formula has very little fat, while kitten food is quite high in it.  Oh, and I've also seen *maybe* one hairball in the last year.  Not bad."
4,Good Food,Science Diet has always been known for decent quality food to feed your cat or dog.  This product is no different.  I have a finicky cat who will only eat certain types of dry food and this seems to be one of them.  She took right to the dry without any hesitation and seems to continue to enjoy it.<br /><br />On the downside is the size of the food.  The food comes in large triangular shaped pieces that some cats may not like.  Buy a small bag and try it for your pet.<br /><br />4/5 stars for the size of the food and the price tag.
5,Meow!,What can I say...this is the only brand of food my cat will eat. She tears into the bag by chewing on it as soon as I get it. I have to pour in into a plastic container. It also controls hair balls.
5,yummi for the cats,We got 2 cats. 1 Siami and 1 Main Coon. Food is great and the cats like it. So what i have to say?
5,Saved my Cat,"This product was recommended by my vet, and literally saved my cat's life. I was very worried and was willing to try any diet on the market. Really, I have tried many diets etc but nothing seemed to help out my cat after the sudden onset of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  I have no idea of where that came from. I always gave him clean water; fresh food etc but this caught me off guard. I have been feeding him ""Friskies"" prior to Hill's and everything was fine until one weekend. After a couple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools (diarrhea), and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also. He was a very big guy (~20 lbs) but now he is down to 16, after about 4 months on Hill's. Thumbs up and 5 stars for this product!"
5,Best cat food ever?,Wow if i knew how much cats would love this stuff i would have been feeding it to any and all of my cats long ago.  You would think it was wet food the way my kitty chows it down.  I got it because he had gingivitus and i had to spend quite a bit to have his teeth worked on.  The vet told me his teeth are still looking nice and clean a few months later!
5,Five stars and an Eight paw Salute,"Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now, I DO feed my cats wet food, so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic, let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks, no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that ""stuff"" is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she, who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee), also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it."
5,Hills Science Diet Oral Care,My cat loves this cat food! He likes the big chunks and if I mix it with another variety which is smaller nuggets he sifts through and pulls out the bigger oral care pieces. Another plus - my cat is 13 and has never had his teeth cleaned. The Vet believes the oral care chunks have been beneficial in keeping down the tartar on his teeth.
5,the only cat food I buy,"My 2 indoor cats have been on this food forever.  They do not get any canned food supplements.  However, with all the Science Diet flavors I often find that the large bag of this one is not in stock when I go to buy it in my local pet stores including the big box stores like Petco or Petsmart.  so finding it on Amazon and eligible for Prime shipping made my day."
5,Only food my cats can agree on,"This is the only flavor of Science Diet (or any other brand) they will all eat without complaint. I don't know what I'll do if they stop making it. I have 3 cats, two Maine Coons who get hairballs, and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to ""improve"" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet! It's a winner as is."
5,vomiting cats?,"We have several cats, one of which has had a vomiting problem for many years.  We tried many cats food.  Science diet sensitive is one of the foods that works.  There are 2 otherss.  1 is Purina 1 Sensitive which is also great.  the other is a Royal Canin Oral Sensitive.  I think the Science Diet and the Purina 1 are the best.  We also give the cat Prednisolone under a Vet prescription, as the vet said it was inflamatory bowel disease."
5,Does what it claims,I had to stop giving my  15 year old cat dry food because he could no longer hold it down (even the ones with only whole food ingredients were too hard on his system).  He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.  His stool became loose and smelled even worse than usual.  I gave him this on a trip that I had to bring him along with me and he has been doing great on it. His stool is hard now and he holds it down.
5,Saved my kitty from having dental surgery!,"I have a multiple cat household.  My vet said ""for the health of the animal"" this cat needs to have his teeth cleaned.  Kitty is a rescue and he gulps his food.  I decided to add Hill's Adult Oral Care to his regular food for two months and see if it made a difference.  Two months later, my vet examined him and he no longer needs the cleaning!  Now every tail in my home has this product added to their favorite food."
5,Bought this for the Fiber,"Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.  They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves..."
5,Blotto cries for it!,"My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet. I did some research, and this stuff is made by the same company, with a nearly identical ingredients list. While i was mixing in his old food with this stuff to acclimate him, he'd pick out the new food until he ate it all, leaving behind his purina!<br />As far as helping his gingivitis, it's helped a little. The plaque has gone down considerably, but the gumline is still reddish. He really loves this stuff, so I'll probably buy this again."
5,My kitty LOVES it.,"The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now."
1,The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?,"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo."
1,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
1,Look at the Ingredient List,"This food is not a good food and is not worth the money.  It contains by products and lots of corn.  It will make your cats fat and lazy.  My friend's cat was vomiting and had been to every vet and had every test but when she switched the food to Innova Evo, the cat stopped vomiting.  Do not buy this food because for the same price you can buy Evo which is grain free and made with table-grade meat. SCIENCE DIET IS GARBAGE!"
1,Worst Junk Food Ever,"I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all."
2,Terrible ingredients but my cat did eat it.,"Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so ""light"" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer."
5,My Kitty Seems To Love It,"I don't know how I could say whether or not the cat food is tasty, but my kitty seems to like it.  My vet recommends this particular brand of food, so that's good enough for me."
1,Please avoid!!,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  Please try another brand like orijen or evo.  your cat will thank you."
5,Excellent cat food,"My cat loves the taste of this food and is very healthy after eating this for years. She has a very healthy coat because she also gets at least 1 can of wet food per day which provides protein and healthy fats.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want a healthy pet, you should do a combination of dry and wet food.<br /><br />The critics have unrealistic nutritional expectations if they are only feeding their animal dry food."
1,Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!,"I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!"
1,Close call!,"I took my 10 year old cat in to the vet today for his yearly check up.  Turns out my cat is the picture of health, but needs to drop about 2 pounds.  The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right.  First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!"
5,cat food,"It's a nice snack with salsa when I'm watching tv.  Just kidding, the cats seem to like it. I'm supposed to write more words so I can submit this review. That should do it."
1,"Wow, I cant believe how expensive a bag of corn is!","No seriously, this is ridiculous, $45 for a bag of corn for obligate carnivores? brewers rice, corn gluten meal? wheres the meat?<br />Not to mention unnamed animal fat which could be anything including roadkill and euthanized shelter animals. There are much better quality grain free foods that cost less then this."
1,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

3,Not tastey,"I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try."
5,Great food for cats,"My two cats love Science Diet. Only problem is I wish they would have a picture of the food on the outside of the bag. There is the dry which is tan, triangle shaped and the other is a dark brown,round shape. I always end up buying the wrong bag and the cats only love one."
1,"BAD, do NOT buy!","Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price."
5,DELICIOUS,"Delicious and good for you.  Orginially purchased for my toddler, some of the pieces are a little large and hard for him so we just share a bag!"
5,"Yummy, crunchy","Add to cereal or eat out of your hand. Each bag has an apple plus other fruit. Nutritious, nothing added."
5,"Tasty, healthy, and satisfying snack!","I have tried all of the Sensible Food crunch dried snacks.  They are all delicious, and these cherry berry ones are my favorites.  The berry taste is sweet and tart at the same time, and the crunch is very satisfying.  Hard to believe that something this tasty is actually good for you.  I recommend all the flavors.  None of them will disappoint!"
4,Heavy on apples,"This is good, but it has too many apples.  I was hoping for more berries.  I was also hoping the kids would like to snack on it, but neither one (a 2 and 6 year old) really likes them.  They are also difficult to eat because the pieces are so small.  However, that makes it great for sprinkling on cereal or oatmeal.  Overall, a good product, worth a try."
4,Great Snack,This is my favorite flavor of the Sensible Foods Fruit snacks. They are gluten free which is necessary for me with Celiac Disease. I love this flavor and like to sprinkle them on yogurt for breakfast in the morning when berries are out of season and so expensive. I wish the pieces were bigger to make it easier to just eat by themselves as a snack. My daughter is diabetic and also loves this line of snacks.
3,Dried Cherry Berry 0.75 oz,I love blueberries but the ones in this pouch remind me of burnt crumbs. I pick them out and eat the rest.
4,"Great Product, with a flaw or two","This product is decent. It provides a nice amount of crunch-dried (a tad different than freeze-dried) fruit with a great taste. While there are mostly apples, the other fruits are represented well enough.<br /><br />The only problem is the fruit dust. Because of the shape of the package, the only way to get fruit out is to tip the pack. Unfortunately, fruit dust always resides at the bottom and easily creates a mess if one is not careful.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this product and hope that the organic version of this will be chosen over the non-organic. With apples being number two on the foods most contaminated with pesticides, organic is the only option."
5,YUMMY!!!,"I was looking for a healthier alternative to Fruit Rollups, Gushers and the like.  I wasn't sure what to expect but these are delicious!!!  They satisfy the ""crunchy"" craving if you are in the mood for chips, and have a wonderful sweet taste if you are craving a fruit snack or sweets.  They have no weird aftertaste (no aftertaste at all except the sweet fruit).  Best of all, they are equivalent to a half cup of fruit.  It IS real fruit, in a different form.  I can't say enough about this snack except I wish it was cheaper.  In this case you get what you pay for.  I highly recommend it and will be purchasing this myself regularly!"
3,ok but tiny pieces,good flavor but apples were a bit stale and pieces were tiny crumb like... too expensive for crumbs.
4,Good,"These dried fruits are excellent.  Toss them on yogurt, cereal or just eat 'em the way I prefer, straight out of the packet.  Good quality.  Perfect for little snackers like my 2-1/2 year old.  I would've liked them even more if there was just a little less apple in this particular mix, but still excellent."
5,Great Healthy On The Go Snack!,"I found this product at my local grocer and then found it cheaper at Amazon. Great snack! I'm a person who likes ""crunchy"" in my diet and most dried fruits are chewy. These dried fruits are great, they are crunchy and light, almost dissolving on your tongue, but packed with flavor! You can't go wrong with these as a snack on the go!"
4,Good healthy snack!,"Good sweet crunch that beats a candy bar. Low in calories has 22% vitamin C, and no additives. I have also added it to bran cereal and yogurt. Good way to get a serving of fruits in and easy to throw in your bag for on the go. I have tried the organic and regular version and no real difference in taste. Organic costs more, of course."
5,great taste,"My whole family loves it. The children take it to school for lunch. I have it in my car, it is just a great healthly and tasty snack."
2,simply waste,"one star cause they're organic<br />one star cause they're pure and nothing added like sugar or so<br />but they reached me mostly pulverized,<br />0,75 ounce are not really satisfying<br />and actually they're missing taste<br />now i will go back to the good old raisins and dried cranberrys etc."
4,Tasty  and Green,"I liked this. It was a nice tasty alternative to fresh fruit. Sometimes you can't do fresh on the go, but this I keep in my car for those quick craving fixes. It is only 1 point if you follow the WW plan. Of course it's green for the environment! Organic, you just can't go wrong there. Will buy again."
2,Not For Me,"Most of the people I work with really liked these, however I didn't.  I would suggest that you try them for yourself."
4,I received the non-organic variety twice!!!,"My son eats an organic diet, and I thought this would be a perfect snack. Oops, I received the non-organic variety. Contacted Amazon, no problem, keep those and we'll send you organic. The label said ""organic"" on shipment 2, but upon opening the box, they weren't organic. Amazon decided to refund my money. I really wanted to try the produce, and found another vendor, no problems and my son enjoyed these snacks. If Amazon could get their act together, I would order these again!"
5,Hot with Substance,"I try as many hot sauces as I can. I put hot sauce on nearly everything. This NW Elixirs Hott Sauce is incredible. Flavorful, spicy, with depth of flavor that seems to have many layers. My mouth is watering as I type this! Time to get put some on chicken for tonight. I highly recommend giving this sauce a try."
5,I love NW Elixirs #2!,"This hot sauce is fantastic!  The verde isn't too hot, but has a nice kick and tons of flavor.  I use it not only as a hot sauce, but as a marinade and a salsa.  I put it on everything from tacos to chicken to pizza.  Give it a try!"
5,YUMMO!,This is the best hot sauce ever! It has the right amount of heat with tons of flavor. I have the red sauce and can't wait to try the green sauce.
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!!,Love this Hot Sauce! You can put it on just about anything. I have bought this for friends and family and they love it to.
5,Best snack bar,"I love that these bars strive to be on the low end of the Glycemic Index (meaning they don't spike your blood sugar levels) and that they use nuts as the base, rather than grains. Although they are more pricey than some other bars (and I am a poor college student) they remain my favorite."
5,Yumm,"The price is just okay, but you do get a variety.  They are harder to find as my local Starbucks keeps running out.  So ordering them from Amazon is a great option."
5,Have always liked this product,"I bought the Almond & Walnut & Macadamia + Protein [12 pack], not the ""item being reviewed"" Fruit & Nut [18 pack]. I purchased these at the $1.10 price per bar that I used to pay ten years ago at Walmart; which is a good deal when you like quality nut bars, and can't find them for under $2.50-$3.00 @ Starbucks. I carry my own bar now to enjoy with their expensive coffee~~~"
5,Kind Bars variety pack,"Excellent price and a great item.  Gluten free and has a great taste.  I have one every afternoon for that 4 o'clock blob time, works great"
4,KIND BARS,I'VE HAD THIS PRODUCT PRIOR TO PURCHASING FROM AMAZON.  I WAS PLEASED WITH KIND BARS I RECEIVED FROM AMAZON. THESE<br />ARE THE ONLY ASSORTMENT OF KIND BARS I WILL PURCHASE IN THE FUTURE. OTHERS ARE TOO RICH AND NOT TO MY LIKING. (18 in a box-fruit and nut is what I will continue to buy).  THEY WERE SATISFYING AND THE NUTS WERE FRESH. GREAT IN BETWEEN MEALS.<br />Thank you.
3,KIND bars rule.....but,"get any other flavor, not sure and maybe I didn't read far enough.... there is only 2 flavors in variety and neither would count as even close to a fav"
5,Bought these as a meal replacement bar,"I enjoyed these a lot more than I expected, as I usually don't like this kind of thing. The surprising part to me was that my family liked them so much, even asked if I had bought more yet."
5,Awesome!,"These are some of the best snack bars I have ever tasted - very pure, you can see everything that's in it, no hidden junk. A little pricey, but much cheaper on Amazon."
5,YUM!,The package arrived and we are quickly making our way through these yummy snacks. Would definitely buy these again and again.
5,Fantastic Snack,"This is a wonderful snack to take in the car, office, bus or wherever you may be on the road.  It is very tasty and good.  I shared some with my granddaughter and she loved it.  She is 4 and I almost retired so that says a lot for the range in taste.  I would highly recommend this for a healthy snack for any age group."
4,Great Snack Option,"I think the Fruit & Nut Delight is a delicious and healthy snack option. My husband really enjoys the Apricot & Almond bar. This box is the best of both worlds, and we're looking forward to buying them again soon.<br /><br />My one criticism; I wish KIND used organic, and healthier ingredients. Soy lecithin, for instance, is less than ideal, as is millet (a known goitrogen, affecting thyroid function)."
5,Excellent snack bar!,"The goal was to replace a few different granola bar favorites with something relatively healthy and better flavors. The KIND bars are a complete victory for me! WOW! I have tried 3 flavors and all are significantly tastier and fulfilling than many of the granola bars. I love the nuts, dried fruits and the overall freshness. Then there is the dark chocolate version which tastes almost naughty! These are homerun choices for me!"
5,DELICIOUS & NUTRICIOUS,This 18 count box of KIND bars was a good value. The free shipping is really a plus. This fruit and nut variety is delicious just like all the others I have tried. Always keep one in my purse in case of a snack attack. Very healthy snack.
5,Love Kind Bars,"You can't go wrong with ""Kind Bars"". I've tried just about all the flavors and my hubby and I love them! They have some good antioxidants, taste great, have great crunch without breaking your teeth like some other bars we've tried. I can't imagine anyone not loving these bars."
5,So fresh!,"I am picky when it comes to snack foods.  Nothing to sweet, nothing too salty, and nothing that isn't good for you.  This pack has two of the best flavored bars I have eaten that come in a package.  I have picked up a subscription to get these mailed out to me each month and am happy I did!"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE these bars!,These are so delicious! I love the KIND bars. They travel well and are very filling without being overly sweet. I have gotten my whole office addicted to them. The Coconut Almond and the Cranberry are my favorite bars for breakfast or a pick-me-up snack but if I crave dessert I will grab the dark chocolate cherry. YUM! My least favorite is the apricot one because I am not a huge fun of dried apricots. Just watch out if you are allergic to soy as the Kind + Protein bars have soy protein.
5,Best bar ever,I buy a lot of snack and health bars because I hike and like healthy snacks.  This is by far the very best tasting one and probably the best one for me.
5,Ultimate Snack Bars,"These are so delicious, a lot of variety, have had myself from local grocery and wanted to share as a gift for my sister. They are habit forming!"
4,Good bars,Very good bars.  Love the sweetness to the bars.  Love the Almond and apricot bar. Fruit and nut delight is ok.  Too much almonds though.  Overall good bars to eat.  A little pricey though.
5,KIND Bar Tastes Great,"This is an excellent snack bar, great tasting and nutritious.  And Amazon sells it for a great price.  Maybe the bar should be a little bigger to be better."
5,Kind bars,"I absolutely love Kind Bars.  Starting buying them from Amazon a few months ago. I've tried various kinds, but I really like the apricot/yogurt ones the best!"
5,Yummie,"I love the Kind Fruit & Nut bars, they are not only good for you but tasty too!  They arrived fresh and provided a savings over purchasing them individually from my local grocery store."
1,Outdated,"I had bought a box of theKind bars back in July of this year. They are delicious, but I ws eating one the other day and noticed the experation date was April 2011! NOT GOOD! Needless to say I won't be buying those on line again or any other food item. I could understand if it was a month out of date, but a year and 3 months - come on. Ridiculous."
1,More Peanuts,I hardly find almonds this bar has just peanuts and 1 or 2 almonds.<br />Not worth the price.Taste is ok.
4,Alternate Uses,"Perfect for our needs.  While we did use the peppermint leaves for cooking, we also used it in outside doorways to keep away unwanted pests (mice) who dislike the smell."
5,Fruit heaven,"One can sells for 3.39 at my local grocery store, so with this special, it's about 2.16/can for 2 8 packs. What a bargain w/ FS. The fruit is soooooo tasty. I usually buy frozen, but this canned is better, so I've converted. I confess I eventually ate a whole can during one evening as a healthy plain fruit dessert since I kept going back for ""seconds"" a few times. Truly the next best thing to fresh."
5,Oregon Fruit Boysenberries,"Boysenberry pie is a favorite in my family but often I can't find canned boysenberries in the store.  When I saw that Amazon had them in the grocery section, I snapped up a pack of 8.  Now I have them in my pantry for whenever I want to bake, and have enough ahead that I won't run out!  The Oregon brand is dependable and the berries are good."
5,Love boysenberries,I grew up in California where we always had boysenberries.  A pie made from them is my favorite.  I used to be able to buy canned boysenberries in Kansas but no longer can.  We were in California in April and I decided to check the internet and was able to find the product there.  Amazon did a great job of making sure I got what I wanted.  Thank you for that.
4,$22.25 for 8 cans,"I love boysenberries, blackberries and mulberries.  Mm, mm Mm, the darker the gentler. The light syrup is not too sweet so I don't mind spooning it in along with the berries.  The berries are mushier than firm but not mush and still somewhat shapely.  It was not difficult to finish a can."
5,Best pie ever,Boysenberry pie made with Oregon Fruit is absolutely exquisite.  I eat it right out of the can too.  A great substitute when fresh boysenberries are unavailable in your area.  LOL.
5,True Boysenberry Flavor - The Best Fruit There Is,"You know, I've been blessed to live in regions where I was able to have all kinds of wonderful fresh fruits, even very exotic varieties.  And of course I've had non-local fruits, including obscure faddish ones.  :)<br /><br />But I've concluded that nothing tops the boysenberry.  It is a flavor that is impossible to describe, because it is utterly distinctive.  There is no other fruit that tastes anything like it, even though it is a brambleberry and bears a close relationship to those.  If you have never tried boysenberry pie, I really urge you to do so.  I've never met anyone who didn't adore boysenberries from the first bite.  Just something about them.<br /><br />So I had some fear ordering this product, because many ""boysenberry"" pre-made products somehow lose much of the charm of real boysenberries.  However, this product is really excellent.  They are obviously canned berries, but they still offer up not only a surprisingly fresh berry effect, but they carry that true boysenberry ""something"" that makes these fruits so wonderful.<br /><br />I've so far just eaten these straight from the can as topping on marzipan cake.  However I full intend to reserve all of the syrup in my freezer until I decide what to make with it.  This stuff is precious.  :)<br /><br />My thanks to the other reviewers who left their feedback to help me decide whether it was worthwhile to try this product.  Pie is in my future!"
5,boysenberries yum,i use these for ice crean. nothing better than vanilla ice cream with spooned boysenberries.amazon rocks as always on price and delivery.Eight cans last me about 2 yrs.thats okay tho.never tried the pie but will soon
4,Boysenberry lust,"I always could find Boysenberries when living in Hawaii, but they are harder to find here in New England.  People used to carry the canned, but no more.  I am very grateful that Amazon makes them available.  My granddaughter and I made my husband his favorite pie last week.  The berries arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I used the recipe on the back of the label.  Superb!  I only gave them four stars as they are canned and not fresh.  Way better than nothing."
5,love these berries,"Wonderful, privately owned company that I've been dealing with for years. always want to support that dying breed of business, trying to survive in the age of corporate takeovers. The product came on time, just like promised. yummy. Need the potassium and other nutrients so abundant in berries."
5,make a great pie,This is my 2nd order. Shipping this time was slower but well worth the wait. Makes a great pie filling. I will be reordering soon.
5,Oregon boysenberries; great stuff!,"Oregon always offers the best of the best. Where else can you get boysenberries? Products are always what they are supposed to be; no fillers, no artificial anything. If you are going to get canned fruit, get something good."
4,Good stuff!!,"I ordered this product for my mom because she loves boysenberry pie and we can't find it in our area. She made a pie using 2 cans of these the minute they arrived. The pie turned out very yummy and made her whole year she said. The only negative thing she said was that she wished the berries were a little less ""mushy"" but for the price they were a perfect fix for her craving. She would definately recommend this product (and has) to others wanting a good product for a good price."
5,The very best.,"Your canned ""Oregon"" boysenberries are the best. Thank you Amazon for sending them to me. I will keep ordering them, thats for sure. Shirley"
5,Oregon Fruit Boysenberries,I can always count on Oregon Fruit for the best boysenberries.  The pie I make with these is a family favorite!
5,boysenberries,These berries do not grow in the east.  I'm happy to be able to get them via mail.
5,Oregon Canned Fruit,All the pie filling I have purchased from Oregon company has been top quality and excellent in flavor.
5,Boysenberry Pie,Purchased Oregon canned Boysenberries. I made pie that was simply delicious.<br />Expensive but worth it.
5,always quick delivery and good price,"I buy this frequently to make boysenberry pies, a favorite for my husband who is from the northwestern US.  The pie instructions are inside the label and it is very easy to make.  I like being able to buy this in bulk and make pies over the holidays!"
5,Excellent,"For  those of us in North Texas, finding where we could get these was great news.  Everyone here thinks blackberries, but these are better!"
5,Boysenberries are back,"In our area, fresh Boysenberries had disappeared.  I discovered by searching on Amazon.com that Oregon Fruit was still canning them and ordered a case.  They are excellent.  Have made pies and used them in jello for hot weather (drain and measure juice as part of liquid then add the fruit).  I will continue to keep these in my pantry.  People have forgotten the delicious taste of these berries.  Black berries are just not the same. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I62E82"">Oregon Fruit Boysenberries in Syrup, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)</a>"
5,Oregon Fruit Boysenberries,"These were bought for a friend who used to get them all the time when he lived in California, but hasnt been able to find them in the East. He was thrilled to receive them and we enjoyed them as soon as they were chilled, over pound cake and vanilla ice cream-yummy! And just last week he said he want to order another case."
5,boysenberries,this product was received in 3 days afer ordering.  I was so pleased that it arrived before Christmas.  Very excellent service!
3,Taste Good,I have just started drinking this tea and I think it tastes like Lipton tea. My Aunt claims she lost 85 lbs from it. You are suppose to drink about 12 oz [1 1/2 cups] after every meal. I figured I'd give it a try? I give it 4 stars because I just started drinking it and I'm not sure of the outcome.
1,Not fresh,"The cookies were not fresh and had become rather crumbly. As much as I love the Famous Amos Oatmeal cookies, I was really disappointed in the quality of what I received. I ended up throwing away 7 of the 8 packs that I received."
5,Great Cookies,"These are the best cookies ever, I sent them as a gift because my sister cannot get them in NJ.  We used to have them in our Publix in Florida, but for some reason they no longer carry them either, only the chocolate chip, not the oatmeal raisin.  She was so pleased with the individual serving size packages."
5,No more trips to Petco,"The girls @ the specialty pet food store won't carry IAMS products because they say IAMS contains fillers & are not healthy.  But these are my dogs favorite biscuit treats & the only reason we would go to Petco.  Actually my dog enjoys the trips to Petco because he can wander around & check out all the smells - Oh well, now we have to find other places for him to smell.<br />Occasionally Petco would be out of the Petite biscuits so buying them in bulk from Amazon is a much better option.  Less expensive too.<br /><br />If the girls @ the specialty pet food store are correct - I cannot say.  All I know is we have been feeding these biscuits to my dog since I got him & we have not evidenced any ill effect.  Actually those girls won't sell any Science Diet or Purina products either - they too apparently have fillers."
3,Kids Like The Shape!,"A fun pasta to help motivate the kids to eat a minimal fat/salt food. The ingredients list wheat flour. Keep in mind this is not the same as WHOLE wheat, so this is not a whole grain food, which in my opinion would be much healthier."
5,Guilt-free mac and cheese,"Great product. The kids like it, you can make it in minutes, and it doesn't contain so much junk that you get mother guilt."
5,Wonderful semi junk food,"Normally I don't purchase this kind of food, but every once and a while you need Mac and cheese from a box.  Being a vegetartian, I love that there are natural enzymes (no animal rennet) in this.  Very hard to find!  Great product and very yummy!"
5,Jolly Time popcorn,My Dad loves this popcorn and the store he was getting it at closed and he couldn't find it anwhere else.  He was happy that I was able to find it online. Thanks:)
5,Best Popcorn,My household is consuming too much sodium so we ditched the microwave popcorn and went back to what our moms and grandmoms popped us...Jolly Time is the best popcorn.
5,Authentic German Version,"My boyfriend went to Germany over the summer and brought back a bag of these. Aside from the German writing/packaging, he had no idea they were any different from what we normally purchase. The German flavors are SO much better than the US version. We are thrilled to have found an importer of these gummy bears. They are the best in the world, hands down."
5,Best Gummi Ever!,"These are hands down the best gummis I have ever tasted.  It may take a minute to get used to the flavors, only because they are so authentically fruity, they don't taste like the overly sweet gummis you are probably used to, but they are definitely worth a try.  These are different then the original German version of Goldbaren, these are the Saft (translated as ""juice"" in English) bears.  The original Goldbaren are much more similar to the Gold Bears sold in the US.  These taste more like actual fruit and come in different flavors: black currant, apple, lime, raspberry, pear, and peach."
1,do not order,I ordered these because they are the real German ones and not the American produced ones (trust me there is a huge difference in taste) but i never received them and when i asked for a refund on my purchase they never got back to me despite the five emails and several phone calls. order at your own risk
5,Delicious Flavors,"My wife and I decided to try these ""German"" flavors and we were not disappointed. We finished the bag within hours of receiving them. If you love gummy bears, give these a try."
3,Basic biscuits,"Nothing particularly special about these biscuits.  You can probably go less expensive for better quality or more expensive for better quality.  Does my dog like them?  Yes, but he also eats everything he can off the sidewalk."
5,Great flavor and no salt!,"I tried some of the Benson's Gourmet Seasonings recently and the Masterpiece Mediterranean is a beautifully balanced blend and one of my favorites.  Just like described it is great on any variety of ground meat.  Extremely flavorful and if you want a little salty type taste you can add a little of  ""Benson's Table Tasty"" after serving.  I am very impressed with Benson's and I recommend these seasonings to all my friends and family (many of whom have to cut their salt intake these days).  I no longer miss the salt as all of Benson's seasonings add so much flavor without salt or potassium chloride."
5,Birds love this food,"The  insect are only in top layer of suet, but the birds love this stuff!  It attracts many different species.  A good source of protein during winter and when raising young."
5,Excellent,Sent the chestnuts to my 89 yr. old mother.  She was delighted to receive them as it brought back memories of she and her siblings roasting chestnuts during the Christmas holidays.  All the chestnuts were fresh and a good size.  Will order again from this vender.
4,YUM!,"I like chestnuts and I always have trouble cooking them. These were easy to work with and cooked perfectly. Just heat the oven to 425 F. With a knife, make a reasonably deep X across the nuts, and bake for 30 minutes. The only reason why I gave a 4* is because I did not like the packaging, it was placed in a paper bag inside a plastic grocery bag. I think they should be put in a zipped or better sealed bag to prevent bugs."
1,molded chestnuts,"The chestnuts arrived closed in a plastic bag and they were all wet... Not a surprise only about 2 out of 25/30 chestnuts were not molded. Everybody knows that chestnuts should be kept in a breathable bag, such as canvas, cloth or paper bag, not sure why the seller ships them in plastic: mold is unavoidable in plastic. Maybe is a biological safety issue. I'm glad I tried 5-6 chestnuts at home before give them as a Christmas gift. I have to throw all them away."
5,The freshes,Excellent! These chestnuts were fresher than the chestnuts purchased in my local grocery store I definately recommend this product! Yum!!
4,Ye Olde Memories,"They were just like I remembered.  It took me back to the first time I had roasted chesnuts, about 35 years ago.  Thanks for the wonderful memories and taste."
5,"Just like Hamburger Helper, without the junk","tastes just like hamburger helper, actually maybe a little better.  i change the recipe - i only add a 1/2 pound of meat (usually organic ground turkey) and add noodles with a little extra water.  easy to throw together in a hurry if you make your ground meat ahead of time, freeze it in 1/2 pound increments and then throw the meat into a large pot to defrost and then finish off with the rest.  they only carry this at 1 grocery store near me (Bloom) which i don't get to very often (wish whole foods carried this one) so it's worth ordering for convenience alone although the price is pretty good."
5,Delicious!,I love this product.  It tastes so much better than Hamburger Helper because it is natural and not loaded with sodium and junk.  I highly recommend it.
5,A great quick meal,"We have been trying to make our food choices a little better lately, buying mostly organic and natural foods, and leaning toward less processed foods. While this is technically a processed food, the ingredients list is completely  identifiable. We bought about 100 lbs of grass-fed beef from a local farmer and this is a great way to cook that up fast and delicious. My husband loved it and asked if I can make it more often. Much tastier than the mostly-chemicals mac-n-cheese and other skillet prepared mixes."
4,Good buy,My junk-food loving husband had a hard time when we switched to all organic food. He (and the kids) were happy when I found these boxes that really do taste just like hamburger helper. I use them with organic ground turkey and then hadd hamburger seasoning to get that hamburger flavor. We get them delivered regularly through Amazons subscribe and save program.
4,Easy dinner,"We love the national brand but don't like the MSG in it.  So, we were very excited to try this.  It tastes very good and we were happy to find it.  It takes a couple of minutes longer to thicken than the national brand, but we won't buy the other one again!"
4,Organic Reinvented............,"Organic has grown into a household name, in recent years. I've seen a rise in healthier alternatives to favorite staples. Annie's has got the formula for mixing healthy choices, with the much loved food products. This is no rabbit meal. Delight in cheesy flavor. No cardboard taste. Perfect for the picky food kids.<br />Great for fast family meals, without the bad stuff!It looks like pasta, and won't crumble."
4,"Actually, Really Good","I was a little skeptical about ordering 6 boxes of this at once, but I'd been wanting to try a healthier version of this dish and none of my local health food stores carry this variety.  I took a chance and ordered it and it was surprisingly very good! Combined with the Subscribe and Save, the price is pretty good too."
5,tastes great,"This tastes absolutely delicious. If my kid had things his way, he'd eat this at least 3 times a week."
5,Better than MSG laced Hamburger Helper.,"There is nothing bad to be said about this product. If you cook it correctly it tastes great. I have eaten plenty of boxes of this stuff. If you mix in organic beef, turkey or chicken with this you are really doing your body a favor. People in this world are too hooked on the garbage ingredients laced into numerous foods products and all the GMOs we eat, enough said. Sorry to say but you are what you eat. Eat healthy and eat organic. Not to mention but there are no GMOs in this stuff."
3,Edible with a spoon,This is very watery and not very cheesy.  Hamburger helper taste much better.  I even add a nice size chunk of velveeta but it's still watery and not very tasty.  Stick with hamburger helper.
5,Caffe d'vita,I love all the caffe d'vita products. I would really love more sugar free choices.<br />But love access to these tasty treats anyway. You'll see I also enjoy the sugar<br />free choices so have ordered them all at some time or other.
5,Delicious Mix,This white chocolate cappuccino mix is scrumptious--a wonderful way to start my day--makes me feel like the day is truly off to a wonderful start!
4,I Liked It,"When I opened this I noticed two things right away:<br /><br />1. It is very, very thin. (Which is a plus for me.)<br /><br />2. It does not contain gooey caramel.<br /><br />So, what did I think? I liked it. This is something I would buy again as a snack. It's basically like white chocolate, except caramel flavored, a lot softer, and way thinner. To enjoy it you put it on your tongue and let it melt. A good treat for when you have a sweet craving, but you don't want to overindulge."
5,Delicious,These bars are a mix of white chocolate and caramel flavoring.  Be warned - there is no gooey caramel in them.  They are very delicious and really do melt in your mouth.
2,not what I expected,"I never had this candy bar before. I thought it was gonna be a hunk of caramel but its a caramel flavored chocolate bar.  I didnt really like it, but I read lots of good reviews about it. I should have read the description of what it was before I bought it LOL. Live and learn."
5,Sub for a meal,"It's great that the biscuits may substitute for a meal.  I need<br />to keep the Cairn's (Jack, 2 years old) food under control<br />because he looooves food.  Both the Westie (Mojo) and the<br />Cairn enjoy the biscuits (which we call ""doggie cookie bones"").<br />It's nice that I can give them a substantial treat and a decent<br />meal simultaneously."
1,Never again...,"Wow.  What a mistake this was!  Hard as rocks and when I shared a couple of samples with friends, they immediately raced to a trash can to spit them out.  Some were okay, some were disgusting.  We ended up dumping the rest in the trash.  Lesson learned..."
5,"Great taste, and killer price","I love the tea, and I love the price.  It brews darker than Republic's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024SCJHS"">The Republic of Tea, Double Red Rooibos, 36-Count</a> offering, and the taste is as intense. I've also tried Teavana's spice rooibos blend, and like it as well.  But the tea I got from Davidson's is just as flavorful AND 1/3rd the price! it ships in a VERY nice container, that was a bit dinged up from shipping. I will continue to order this replacing Teavana and Republic's Tea's"
5,Genuine Tea,"This is genuine tea, no extra flavours, or herbs. I have yet to try other brands, but if you're going for the pure taste and raw aroma of roiboos, I recommend this one.."
5,Rooibos tea,This tea is wonderful!  I thank elanaspantry.com for helping me to find it.  It has a mild flavor and I love the fact that it's fresh and organic!  I will definately be ordering more.  Thank you much!  :)
3,Unique,"This tea is very fresh and is not too fine that it will wash into your cup with normal infusers. This tea's taste is very unique as to the flavor, it tastes like a fermented cucumber mixed with a mild black tea? It's so hard to explain. It's not particularly to my favor. I still have nearly 4 cups left of it on my burner. I tried it with soy milk (lactose intolerant) after trying it plain; I can't quite create a cup to my liking (I will keep trying). The single pack tea bags that came with my purchase from the Davidson's Tea vendor were unexpected and delicious, thus the tea price with the combined fedex shipping was well worth it for the fantastic trial pieces that I plan to purchase in the future."
5,Favorite seasoning,"This seasoning is, by far, my family's and friends' favorite. Great flavor everytime! Easy to use and you can adjust how much seasoning you want to use."
5,Very good spice kit,"This kit is very good especially at the price.  This was my first time making Venison jerky, and this kit fits the meat perfectly.  Mix in 1 cup of Jack Daniels for each pound to add a little more flavor."
5,too expensive but delicious.,"These are some of the best tasting sausages in the world. Low fat, lots of herbs. Savor them slowly because they are so pricey!<br />Not to put on cheap hot dog buns. The best is on a french baguette of course!"
5,Caffiene Free!,"I love this product, but I live in the wilds of Arizona, and it's not available locally.  I was surprised when i found it on Amazon, but relieved, nothing gets me up in the morning faster than chocolate!"
5,Great,My dogs love these bones.  I bought all sizes.  My jack russel loves the big ones and the small ones.  My 60 pound mutt loves the big ones. They are great.  They are able to digest them and able to enjoy the bones.  I bought so many of them.  Petsmart for some reason discontinued them I was so upset.  I was so happy to see them on Amazon for a great price. I highly recommend them.
4,Doesn't last long for agressive chewers,I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.
5,Great for dogs with stomach problems,"My dog gets sick eating a lot of dog treats (even Milkbones), but has always done well with all the Booda bones.  She really loves them & they're good for getting rid of the tartar on her teeth.  I highly recommend these."
5,R dog luvs these,Our Siberian Husky is overweight and on a diet.  She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth - baad breath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.  Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and breath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!
5,Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!,"Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of ""Brian Amazon"" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing)."
5,"Booda Bone Dog Treats, 9 Pack",My dog loves Booda Bones.  They are a bit pricy so I only give him a couple a week as a special treat.  I'll continue buying them from Amazon for the best price.
5,Very Healthy!,We have a dog with a liver shunt - so she can't have a lot of protein / can't digest protein.  Booda Bones are the BEST treat for her (and our other dog loves them as well!).  The only 'downside' whatsoever is that they're a tad expensive - but they're worth it!
4,More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.,"Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick."
3,Dog is not a fan,"My dog loves the chicken, steak, and peanut butter booda bones, but he's not as fond of the spearmint/peppermint variety.  My dog will eat it if offered, but my dad's dog who I often sit for will not even touch these.  I wouldn't recommend for a dog who prefers meat."
5,My dogs have rated Booda Bones 5 Stars!,"I have three King Charles Cavalier Spaniels and they are picky, picky eaters even when it comes to Treats.  They love the peanut flavored Booda Bones and have one every day.  They insisted I write this review on Amazon so their opinions could be known.  They're pushy that way..."
2,NOT long lasting,"I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though."
4,"Dog really likes, but they go fast.","I have an 11 pound Couton De Tulear.  Small sharp teeth.<br /><br />Dog loves them.<br /><br />These don't last long.  From a value standpoint, I prefer ""Checkups,"" when Costco has them in stock."
5,love that these are yogurt flavor!  my dog loves booda bones!,I have no problem w/my dog eating these.  He loves these booda bones. I had never seen the yogurt ones; he loves them.
5,Dog Treat,"Our dog, a Siberian Husky, just loves Booda Bones.<br />We give her one for lunch most everyday and she<br />pesters us till we give it to her."
5,Chloe loves them!,"Our Boston Terrier loves these bones - we give them to her as a treat or to keep her busy when we have company.  For a 16 lbs. dog she's a mighty chewer and these last her a couple of hours, with breaks to investigate if she's missing anything!  We'll buy more of these!"
5,My dog goes crazy for these!,"My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them."
5,my dog loves these,My 3 year old miniature schnauzer loves these bones. I'm really glad that they started making them wheat-free because he has food allergies.
4,Awesome bones,My dogs beg for these treats every night after dinner.  I always make sure I have plenty of supply at hand.
5,"great prices, fast delivery!",My dog is addicted to these and they're actually fully digestible and don't hurt anything. I've purchased them from everywhere on the planet and will buy from here from now on!
1,My dogs do not like the flavor,Regular flavor Budda Bones are great for my dogs but they apparently do not care for the minty flavor on these.
5,Dog loves them,The dog really loved these bones and it seemed to freshen her breath.  It was a good treat for a dog with tummy troubles.
5,Booda bones,My dog really enjoys the Booda bones.  I was very pleased with the price I received and also the fact that they arrived  earlier than expected.
5,YUM YUM,OUR BEAGLE JUST  LOVES THIS PRODUCT<br />SHE TAKES ONE WITH HER WHEREVER SHE GOES<br />ESPECIALLY LIKES O CHEW WHILE IN THE CAR
5,YUMMMMM!!!!,We have three darling Shitzus.  All of them adore Booda Bones and look forward to this wonderful treat.  Thank you Amazon!!
5,THE BEST!,"I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics."
5,great,"These are great, but my dog likes to augment them with other types of bones"
1,disappointed,"These took FOREVER to ship and when they did arrive they were not as durable as advertized.  Was looking for a bone to keep our dogs busy, these were more like a snack."
5,Way to great chicken!,"I was pleasantly surprised with this blend of seasonings.  It is great for chicken and all other types of poultry.  I especially like it for roasted chicken and oven fried chicken.  I really like the no-salt feature, because it allows me to control my own salt content and flavor.  With this blend, a little goes a long way, so don't over-apply it.  Start with a light application and build it up a little at a time to suit your own taste.  It is also very economical, and is actually much cheaper than those small bottles you get in most grocery stores.  Another feature I liked was getting a fresh batch with your order.  The company advertises that they mix a fresh batch for your order, and I believe they do.  The aroma of the spices when you receive your order indicates that they are fresh.  Makes a big difference in their use.<br /><br />  Trapper Tom<br />  Mahnomen, MN"
5,NO SALT,Wonderful spices to add to your chicken or soup recipes. The 'no salt' label caught my eye. It smells and taste great.
5,Jumbo peanuts were GREAT!,"These were fresh shelled peanuts with no signs of mildew or damage at all. Fresh, white JUMBO nuts that roasted up fresh.<br /><br />How to oven roast:<br />Wet the peanuts and drain well.<br />Spread out on flat sheet or pizza pan.<br />Salt to taste.<br />Roast in 250 degree oven for 45-60 minutes or until just right.<br /><br />The freshest nuts in the world!"
5,Peanut Brittle nuts,I have purchased Aunt Ruby's and Bertle County raw peanuts in the past.  These are as good or even better.  Very pleased.  Peanut Brittle with these is fabulous.  Nuts are quite large.
5,worth every penny,i can't get raw peanuts in west tennessee where i live i was born and raised in georgia where you can buy these anywhere reminded me of my childhood they arived on time and the product was exactly as discribed i would order again in the future
5,Great buy!,"When I ordered these peanuts I had no idea they were going to be so big! The nuts are larger than I have found in years and are very tasty in my peanut brittle. Shipping was great, they arrived well packed and fresh. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who uses raw peanuts."
4,Shell Peanuts - Royal Oak Gourmet,These are bigger than normal peanuts and the taste good. It does not have the taste of Spanish peanuts but have a good taste. I like Spanish peanuts but the price is on the higher side than this product
4,Raw Peanuts,I have just received it. It has large size but is not real fresh. Have not open the bag yet.
4,Big size peanuts.,The peanuts are big in size and arrived on time . We like it since it comes with the skin on.<br />We make it salted at home. Enjoy it very much.
1,Poor service,"I would agree with the other poor ratings for Royal Oak - very poor customer service from Royal Oak. We ordered, this year, the exact same product as last year. When it arrived, the nuts were not the same product, and they would not refund shipping or pay shipping for the return. Also, they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are 'in season.' Otherwise, emails and phone calls are not even acknowledged."
5,First time jitters no more!! Truly Beautiful!!!,"I got this for a good friend's birthday, this being my first online Plant purchase naturally I was petrified that something could go wrong......possibly that the plant would not survive it's long journey intact! But thankfully it was received just in time and in pristine condition looking just like it did in the picture on the site. Living, breathing, lovely......Great gift!!! I will surely do this again!!!"
5,Beautiful and arrived very healthy!,"I am very satisfied with this product. I was a little wary buying a plant online, but its not available at any local nurseries. It arrived very well wrapped. I watered it a few times a week and within several months it blossomed into a giant plant! In the spring, it bloomed a beautiful white lily. Unfortunately, I had to move the plant into a larger pot and some gnats decided to make the soil their new home. I had to move it outside, but its still going strong!"
5,Peace Lilys Perform,"The Peace Lily is one of the nicest gifts you can give a person. It sends a powerful message of peace and love to another: colleague, sibling, parents, rivals...anyone to whom you might want to send a wish.<br /><br />The Peace Lily is a hardy, easy-to-keep plant that does well indoors or outdoors, so it is a welcome addition to any environment."
1,Smoked Mackerel to be avoided,"Mackerel is an oily fish, making it a healthy choice. Sadly this was not. Delivery was prompt and well packed, vacuum sealed plus ice packs in a well insulated box, but the product itself was very poor. The fish was so dry that it was akin to eating sand. Maybe the vacuum packing process does this or maybe it was just old product, although the best by date was still a year away. No repeat order from me!"
5,Positively scrumptious!,"These wafers are wonderfully light and taste just like Nutella. They're the perfect size for snacking, and incredibly addictive. :)"
5,Excellent!  Fresh and so soooo tasty!,"These dainty cookies crunch out mountains of chocolatey hazelnut flavor.  Each one is a new discovery of deliciousness.  The hazelnut is very prominent, not covered up by the chocolate at all.  Oh they're so good.  You will love them!"
1,Chunks of shell in every bite,"While this soup tasted pretty good, I just can't get over all the chunks of shell in almost every bite.  It really made this an unpleasant experience to eat. I don't know if this is normal for this product or if this was just a bad batch, but I was picking bits of shell out of my mouth with almost every bite.  Not a fun experience."
5,AWESoME FRESH TASTING LOBSTER SOUP.  Just Heat an Serve.,"No doubt about it this is just the right combination of Lobster, scampi, prawns with a hint of Dry white wine & a dash of brandy finish this soup to perfection.<br />Ingredients<br />Water, Lobster (4%), Cod (3.5%), Scampi (2.5%), Concentrated Tomato Paste, Modified Cornflour, White Wine, Prawns (1.5%), Skimmed Milk Powder, Butterfat, Double Cream, Salt, Yeast Extract, Sugar, Shrimp Powder, Fish Powder, Vegetable Oil, Vegetable Extracts, Stabiliser (Polyphosphates), Brandy, Concentrated Lemon Juice, Spices, Herb and Spice Extracts with celery.<br />*No Artificial Colours<br />*No Artificial Flavours<br />*No Artificial Preservatives<br /><br />Information<br />Gluten Free<br />Contains: MILK, FISH, SHELLFISH, CELERY."
2,Very Disappointed.,"While I have been pleased with Baxter's soups for years, I will not buy Baxter's Lobster Bisque.<br /><br />The flavor is bland and I have yet to find a piece of lobster in the soup.<br /><br />Further, the soup is available at Publix Supermarkets in Florida for less than the price it is offered here."
5,Great Gum,"Xylitol is much better for you than any of the chemically sweetened mainstream gums that use things like Aspartame. Research studies have proven Xylitol is effective at preventing tooth decay, different experimenters used different amounts of Xylitol. As the previous reviewer mentioned, some researchers claim that there is a threshold which must be met for the results to be significant, and this is debatable. What isn't debatable is the fact that this gum is not harmful for the body unlike artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />""In another study (with Xylitol), researchers had mothers chew xylitol gum when their children were 3 months old until they were 2 years old. The researchers found the children of the mothers in the xylitol group had ""a 70% reduction in cavities (dmf)"" when they reached 5 years of age.[15] Recent research[16] confirms a plaque-reducing effect and suggests the compound, having some chemical properties similar to sucrose, attracts and then ""starves"" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption. (However, this same effect also interferes with yeast micro-organisms and others, so xylitol is inappropriate for making yeast-based bread, for instance.) This is because cariogenic bacteria prefer fermentable six carbon sugars, or disacharrides such as sucrose, as opposed to the nonfermentable xylitol, whose antimicrobial properties then ""starve"" the bacteria, reducing their growth and reproduction."""
1,Lacking in taste,"I bought this due to the lack of Xylitol gum on the shelves anymore (thanks aspartame monopoly), but the taste is just not there.  It is really chalky and what flavor is there does not last long.  I will be looking for an alternative."
5,Yummy,This green tea gum is delicious.  I keep it in my knapsack as a healthy treat for the kids.  Highly recommended.
2,Loses flavor too quickly; not really worth the higher price,"My dentist recommended Spry, so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's pricier than most of the sugarfree gums I frequent, but it came recommended by an oral expert, so I figured it would be worth a try.<br /><br />NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Literally, after less than 4 minutes, the flavor is completely gone, and the gum itself reverts to a stale, slightly metallic, tough-to-chew state of existence. I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?<br /><br />Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.<br /><br />Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards ""No Thanks"" is the fact that it is not worth its value.<br /><br />Also (this is USEFUL), I've tried the Spearmint, Citrus & Green Tea, and out of the three, the Green Tea tastes the weirdest. It's almost matcha-like in flavor, but there's something off, like it's almost like someone took the descriptions of what Green Tea tasted like without actually ever tasting it, and then tried to re-create the flavor in the gum. It's very artificial tasting, with the barest of hints of Green Tea.<br /><br />This is USEFUL information for those who want to chew gum to freshen their breath, or prolong the feeling of minty goodness in their mouth for more than just a couple of minutes!"
5,Why hasn't anyone thought of this before???,"This cinnamon has a rich warm flavor that will remind you of a Vietnamese cinnamon, it is not your typical Ceylon. Forget about how easy it is to tuck in a purse or briefcase. Forget how it will enhance every single cup of restaurant coffee or bland white rice.  Studies have come out touting cinnamon's ability to stabilize blood sugar, so I gave a tin to a diabetic friend. She claimed that after a teaspoon a day, within a week she noticed a difference. How amazing that something so delightfully flavorful might (for some) have a health benefit!  I sprinkle it in lentil soup, meatloaf, spaghetti sauce, on toast, and in anything chocolate. Any 'foodie' would love this elegant little tin."
5,perfecto,"These tiny packets are perfect! Now to find these with cinnamon and ""sugar"". That would be perfect for travel. These are perfect for travel and a great size for adding to oatmeal, cream of wheat, coffee, tea, ice cream, pies.... Don't forget about those of you, whom like myself, don't do a lot of baking but still like to have the basic ingredients around. This is perfect especially since they are premeasured, portioned 1 teaspoon packets. Once I run out of the 3 pack, which equals 36 1 teaspoon packets, I'm sure I will buy some more."
5,Best Cinnamon!!!,This Cinnamon is purely the best! The taste is great and the 1tsp packets are great for taking anywhere on the go.
3,convenient,"the pros: convenient to carry and use small amount sealed package<br />cons: the""true"" cinnamon taste is similar to other commercial cinnamons for my taste buds"
5,gourmet on the go,"Sweet fresh flavor and easy packaging. One teaspoon is more cinnamon than necessary as the packet will garnish several hot beverages. It is a pack of 3 tins, but a single tin with 12 packets makes a respectable token gift.<br /><br />If buying for oneself and especially for home use, the sticks available at the grocery are more practical. They use less packaging and cost less. They can be found in a small plastic bag usually with a Hispanic market label (at least in Texas). Recognize this product by its layers within the stick."
1,dry beans,"I did not like this coffee at all.  The beans were dry and tasted terrible, kind of like saw dust.  I was hopefull that each new bag I opened would be better, but to my dissapointment, they were all horrible.  I would not recommend this coffee to anyone!"
3,Very interesting product....,"Presumably, this flavor is created mainly for children.  So, with that in mind, this flavor tastes very good to them.  However, here's the clincher.  Don't get near them while they are chewing the stuff.  I don't know what they use to flavor this gum, but it gives people the absolute WORST breath you've ever smelled!  Something reminicent of a pig farm, if you know what I mean!  Really, it smells nothing like watermelon on their breath - it smells like you are actually downwind of your local farmer's pig pen.  Honestly, it's really that bad.  Strangest experience I've had for awhile with food.  Anyway, the kids love the taste and actually, it's really pretty good.  Just don't pop one of these in your mouth before you're going out for the evening.  People will wonder what you've been eating!"
5,excellent food for large breeds with joint problems,My 10 year old saint bernard is moving around like he did when he was a puppy!  I see a very notable difference in him since he started eating the Breeders choice active care foods!  I couldn't be more pleased!
5,My dog loves this food... and the food loves her!,"We have a Vizsla and struggled to find a food that #1 she liked and #2 that didn't give her the runs (sorry - gross, I know).  This was the first food that met both requirements.  Given that her breed is prone to hip problems, the extra glucosamine helps to keep her joints healthy.  The food is pricy, the packaging isn't flashy and the name may not be well known - but this food is working for us."
5,We have a new dog,Our 12 year old dalmatian is acting like a dog of 8; so says her vet. Classy was slowing down and having trouble moving around. A friend recommended Active Care to us and we've seen a real change after 6 weeks.
4,retriever's recommendation,"our 3 retrievers are 9,8 and 3 years young and we're working hard to keep them healthy and not go bankrupt.  We were using another joint supplement that works great but costing $$$$.  We decided to use this food in the am and pinnacle's chicken and oatmeal for the pm meal.  High quality food that won't kill my budget.  The dogs love the taste, their coats are shiny, joints are moving well and yard clean up is minimal."
1,"Another error, Wake up!","Here's another 4.4lb bag of dog food that does not represent the normal ""regular"" price. At that standard per pound price, you could be buying the juiciest prime filet mignon and get to watch man's best friend become even a better best friend! Wake up Amazon!"
5,Ideal diet for a Rhodesian Ridgeback,"This is the only food our 12 year old Rhodesian Ridgeback has ever eaten (plus a single square of Kraft American cheese daily as a treat and a few chicken breast treats.)  Kramer is in great health and people are always amazed at how fit and strong he is.  That he still has all his teeth is surely attributable to the Active Care hard kibble diet and the near absolute lack of any signs of arthritis must be one of the benefits of the ""healthy joint formula.""  Both Kramer and I cannot recommend Active Care highly enough."
4,new mobility for your dog,"My 11 year old St Bernard has some arthritis, and was having a lot of difficulty standing up and using stairs.  After just one bag of Active Care dog food, there is a noticeable difference in his comfort level!! He moves with much greater ease!  And, after several bags, he has not gotten tired of the food, he still is eager for dinner! Terrific product!"
5,The absolute best gluten free cookie ever!,"I got a free sample chocolate chip cookie from the company's website as I wasn't sure about ordering a package without trying one first, but I shouldn't have worried.  These cookies are amazing!  Really, they will leave you saying Wow!  They are thick, moist, and chewy, which is not easy to find in a gluten free cookie.  They're also very generously sized, so one is more than enough to satisfy a sweet craving.  I think they're probably better than most ""regular"" cookies I've had!  I'll definitely be ordering some!"
5,"I think these are delicious little, ready to eat fish!","Mackeral is one of the best fish you can eat for the Omega 3's (DHA & EPA) along with sardines and salmon.  These mackeral are packed skin and bone free....no worry about picking little bones out before you eat!  They are a delicious mild fish.  They are packed in soybean oil which I DO NOT like but it's a minute amount so I ignore that my preference of Extra Virgin Olive Oil is not used.  If EVVO can be used in the cans of boneless and skinless sardines.....why can't it be used with these??  Anyway...these are absolutely scrumtious.  The cans are tiny so I consider them one serving and they are expensive but the price on Amazon is terrific.  They are like sardines but without that ""fishy"" after taste.  I love sardines too so they are both a wonderful complete protein.  I sometimes eat them as the protein in my meal or sometines as an afternoon treat...right out of the can.  I guess if you don't like sardines you should try one can locally before buying the 25 pack from Amazon.  I will be buying these again and stock up when the great Roland sale returns!"
3,not the healthiest mackerel?,"I purchased a can of Roland mackerel in soy oil at my local grocery store, and found within delicious small (like large sardines) fish. On that basis I ordered this item from Amazon. The fish in these cans is much larger: each can contains just part of single fish. The flavor is fine but my concern is that these are king mackerel, which are less healthy for your diet than other species (as you can check yourself with an Internet search). There is less omega-3 and, probably more importantly, likely to be more of the man-made pollutants that accumulate in larger fish. Of course the real solution is that we stop polluting the oceans so badly! But until that happens, I will prefer to eat smaller fish."
5,Simply Good Eats,Just ate my first tin and oooh boy! These little fish are delicious. Just the right amount of salt and in soybean oil. Wonderful way to stave off hunger...BEWARE Not for those who don't like fishy treat ;-)
5,Best Mackerel,"This mackerel is very good and tasty, and inexpensive. It is right up there with sardines as very healthy fish. If you can find them, cans like this cost around $2.50 to $3.00 a can. Just drain the oil and enjoy."
5,Roland Canned Mackerel,"This stuff is great.  I used to eat this when I was a very poor college student.  Between the canned mackerel and alot of walking I lost 30 pounds.  Now I am alot older and still love it.  My husband and I work out in our woods.  This is a convenient, easy, healthy and delicious food to take with us.  It is also an easy go-to food when I am too lazy to prepare something.  I bought a case of it and will be buying another soon."
4,mackeral dackeral,i ordered a different brand that i had tried before but amazon said they would put me on a waiting list. i waited for a month or so and then ordered the roland brand.<br />in the process i learned that mackeral are seasonal. seems the best mackeral is only available in the spring when the omega3 oils are more than double as they are in the fall. the taste is very satisfactory but i'm still wondering if these mackeral are from the spring catch with lots of omega 3 or another time of year when they have less omega 3 because it doesnt list on the tin when they were caught.
5,Very tasty!,I ordered this product and was not disappointed.  The Mackerel is very tasty and is wonderful on bread or crackers.  Highly recommended if you like mackerel.
5,"Bargain price, tastes great!","Can't get this at my grocery anymore, and it was close to $4 a tin anyway.  Love this stuff.  So much better than tuna.  Great for work."
5,Roland Mackerel fillets,Roland Mackerel Fillets is a very good fish.  I got it from Amazon.com because this product was alot cheaper here than the store.  When we run out I will buy somemore. Also I love the free shipment...
5,Very Good,Very tasty. I usually buy the mackerel in Olvie Oil but this is just as good. It doesn't have nearly the amount of oil that the ones packed in Olive Oil do. Very good price.
5,"tasty, firm fish","This has got to be my favorite canned fish.  Firm, mild tasting, meaty.  One can will satisfy me."
5,"Nourishing, Healthful, Deliscious","Experts agree that conventional salt, sea salt, and himalayan crystal salt are very different substances. All three have been analyzed microscopically and nutritionally.Himilayan Crystal Salt was the most nutritive, while the conventional salt and sea salt were not. However, knowledge is easily to verify these days without the need for biased opinion. The science is in, it's tops for trace minerals and thus nutrition; and for this culinary artist my opinion is it is simply deliscious."
5,"The Bursting Flavor and Healing Power of Blessedly Beautiful, Simple Salt Crystals","These crystals have the minerals intact, which is vital to the salt benefit and function.<br /><br />I don't know when or why purveyors of salt began removing the natural mineral content, but that action involved a frightening ignorance.<br /><br />For certain types of specific health issues (see below), the minerals in the sea salt crystals seem to work better for me in their crystalline (or coarse) form, than when I grind the salt, as I do for cooking or table usage salt.<br /><br />As others have noted, mineral-rich, coarse-sea-salt freshly grinded onto food is much crisper in its culinary effect, more satisfying to the taste buds, than pre-granulated, plain table salt (which has the minerals removed, minerals found naturally in sea salt and which enhance both health benefits and flavor bursts).<br /><br />Also, old style, granulated table salt has an added disadvantage from the fairly recent addition of a variety of anti-caking chemicals, some of which contain aluminum (silicoaluminate)... which I'm concerned may be a brain cell deteriorative, possibly at baseline cause for Alzheimer's.<br /><br />If I take a pinch of salt crystals (coarse sea salt contains crystals) 2 or sometimes 4 times per day, and place them in my mouth, moving them around to dissolve the salt in saliva on my teeth and gums, I find that both teeth and gums retain a much higher degree of health.  I had begun having minor tooth aches periodically, and this practice has alleviated that.<br /><br />As noted above, I'm 60-years-old; and with a debilitating liver ailment since I was 9, I find that when I have an attack of severe abdominal and back muscle cramps (which I get fairly frequently), a pinch of sea salt crystals in my mouth will stop those cramps.  In fact, when I take small amounts of sea salt crystals regularly enough, I don't get those cramps at all.  The cause and effect is immediate and direct, so I know this works for me.  From my experience, plain table salt, or even sea salt without the mineral content will not give this beneficial effect.  (I'm guessing it's the magnesium content which works here, though, it might be the wholeness of the natural balance of the particular mineral group within unadulterated salt).<br /><br />Of course, I also drink one, preferably two glasses of water along with the salt crystals, ingesting the water before, after, or both.<br /><br />I learned about the many benefits of sea salt crystals (with the natural mineral content not having been leached away in well meaning ignorance) from Dr. Batmanghelidj's book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970245823"">Obesity Cancer & Depression: Their Common Cause & Natural Cure</a>.  I recommend that book very highly and hope to be able to review it also.<br /><br />Dr Batman's books explain how, when, why, and how much water the body needs for optimum health, and sea salt crystals are a vital part of that program.<br /><br />Note that in this book he explains also how, when, and why a person can take too much salt and water. I suppose I'm ""lucky"" that I have a barometer for sea salt crystal needs.  When I'm not taking enough the cramps return.  During hot weather (or under other dehydrating conditions) when the body loses more salt and water, I have to increase the intake of both.<br /><br />As far as I recall, Dr. Batman hadn't mentioned the connection of sea salt to alleviate regular large muscle cramping.  That I discovered this on my own after I had been taking the sea salt regularly, due to reading Dr. Batman's book.<br /><br />Bless this man for standing up to so many medical fallacies which are literally creating diseases, then causing addiction to high cost medications which do NOT cure the ailment, but add several other ailments into a complex medical condition which piles prescriptions on top of prescriptions.<br /><br />My thanks to Amazon for providing a variety of excellent sea salt products in coarse, crystalline form.<br /><br />With Respect for the maverick M.D.'s who actually apply and teach true healing,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books on KINDLE and Amazon Shorts"
5,"I love this salt, and I will never go back to regular salt.","I had purchased this salt previously from another site, and I was very happy to find it here.  I use the salt stones for a relaxing bath, the coarse salt in my salt mill, and the fine salt in my shakers.  I love the flavor of the salt, and I enjoy the fact that this salt is natural and not chemically produced like most table salt.  I hope to continue enjoying this salt for years to come."
5,Dr. Oz was right about this product!,"This year, I have been plagued with allergies and hay fever more than ever. Reluctantly, I have taken Singular all summer to keep my allergies at bay. One day, I caught a segment on the Dr. Oz show about simple solutions to help with allergies and hay fever. He suggested this product specifically. While still watching the program, I jumped onto Amazon and ordered it immediately.<br /><br />It works!  I've been using this product for about 3 weeks and have seen dramatic improvement. That is not to say that this product works for everyone. However, I have bought seven more for my husband and six children.<br /><br />Why put chemicals in your body if a homeopathic treatment works better? However, as written above, this product may not do the trick for everyone, but it sure works for me."
5,The Best,"Nicely packaged and high quality salt, use it everyday for a healthy salt, will be ordering more when I run out Shipping was fast."
5,salty and pretty,Very nice looking salt. DOnt know if the healing has begone but we love it & use it everyday! As per Dr OZ!
